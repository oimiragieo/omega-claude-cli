# Omega Claude CLI (headless)

When the user wants to **use Claude** (Claude Code CLI) for analysis or brainstorming from another agent, use the **omega-claude-cli** skill and run the **headless script** (no MCP).

## When to use

- User says "use Claude", "ask Claude", "analyze with Claude", "brainstorm with Claude", or similar.
- Task benefits from Claude's context or a second model's perspective.

## How to run Claude

From the project root (where `.claude` lives), run:

```bash
node .claude/skills/omega-claude-cli/scripts/ask-claude.mjs "PROMPT"
```

Optional: add `--model sonnet` or `--model haiku` (CLI has 3 models: Default/Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5) or `--json`. Build the prompt from the user's request and any @ file refs. Return the script's stdout as Claude's response.

## If Claude Code CLI is not set up

If the script fails (e.g. "claude not found"), suggest the user run **/omega-claude-setup** and complete Node + Claude Code CLI install and one-time auth. See .claude/skills/omega-claude-cli/references/installation.md and references/auth.md.
